# PowerShell counterpart to pgo-build.sh. Canonical entry point for the
# native-release-pgo Maven build on Windows. Wraps `mvnw -P native-release-pgo`
# with a finally block + Ctrl-C handler that brings the docker compose stack
# down whether the build succeeds, fails, or is interrupted.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh scripts/graalvm-pgo/pgo-build.ps1 install
#   pwsh scripts/graalvm-pgo/pgo-build.ps1 verify -DskipTests

# Ctrl-C handler — PowerShell raises a PipelineStoppedException that's caught
# by the try/finally below; this just makes Ctrl-C feel responsive.
